
Occasional misreads of data from dome serial.

   Flush serial in Arduino?

Crash when configuring VENTTIME on connection to driver. 
Maybe this is the Arduino failing to connect sometimes?

Use LastStatus string if not connected

Get Status process working

Add sneak peak back in

Halt - needs to restore Open/Close shutter button colors
   restore power/open image, flashing light image
   Works OK when actually opening; fails when waiting for powerup.

Implement driver setting/config screen. 
    List of com ports
	IP Address / Listen port

Still problems when can't connect to shutter arduino.

Run string param to show Test, POS#

Debug versus Production versions of driver
Change the identification of the developmental one so it is different than the 
production one. In other words, it needs to be a different driver (has different 
class/interface IDs/GUIDs and different dotted name). Then you can even flip back and 
forth with ACP as well as your other test tools. At a minimum, add "2" or "New" 
to the end of the dotted name and regen all of the GUIDs (library, interface, and 
class IDs) so it's independent of the other one.
